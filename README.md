This is a small full-stack medical web application project that uses a React Front-end and Apollo GraphQL as a backend with the following implementations:
- Authentication and Authorization for regular users and administrators.
- CRUD Functionalities for various datasets with authorization requirements for some.
- An AI Chatbot implementation that recommends medical steps following certain symptoms and descriptions. (using a trial AI ware, might not be functional if trial is over).
- Simple UI Interface.
- Ready for Deployment.

This was the Final Project for the Emerging Technologies course at Centennial College (2025). Code was built using sound programming principles and practices learned in Class
AI was used minimally/not at all for learning experience purposes.
